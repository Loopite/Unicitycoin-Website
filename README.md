Unifycoin is a cryptocurrency which uses a  Proof Of Stake (POS) protocol to create new blocks during consensus.
Although this crypto uses a peer to peer system, and so a decentralized form of technology, you can download the blockchain fast. Your transactions are shared with the whole network and confirmed.
This project is only the website of this crypto. You will be able to create a new account on the website, explore the blockchain, follow any transactions without synchronizing the blockchain...

If you are interested in having a look at the  crypto’s main code (C++), please note it will be published under the name ‘Unifycoin-Wallet’ in the next few days.
